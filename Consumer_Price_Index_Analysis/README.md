## Consumer Price Index Analysis 
### Overview
Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis involves tracking the average price change over time for a basket of goods and services typically consumed by households. It serves as a primary measure of inflation, which helps companies and governments understand purchasing power trends, inflationary pressures, and economic stability. 

### Dataset 
Link to Download dataset : https://statso.io/cpi-analysis-case-study/  <br>
The dataset contains Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for various sectors (Rural, Urban, and Combined) across different months and years. The columns include detailed CPI values for different product and service categories such as Cereals and products, Meat and fish, Milk and products, Fruits, Vegetables, and more. Additional columns include CPI data for services like Housing, Health, and Transport and communication, as well as an overall General index which represents the cumulative CPI across all categories.<br> 
### Objective 
The objective of this analysis is to understand the patterns and trends in CPI over time, particularly examining how inflation impacts specific sectors and product categories. I tried to ans these questions :<br>
- Inflation in general CPI Index.
- CPI comparision across different sectors or regions.
- Correlation between various categories.
- CPI and Specific sector analysis
- Effect of COVID -19 on prices.
### Key Insights
- The CPI values are almost same in all regions : Rural, Rural+urban, Urban which means price changes in goods and services are fairly uniform across these regions.
- All the categories are postively correlated with each other.Categories such as Housing, Transport and communication, and Miscellaneous show high positive correlations with each other.
- Each sector shows a general upward trend over time, which indicates rising prices. Fuel and light have experienced the steepest increase, particularly after 2020, which reflectes higher inflation in this category. Health and Housing have followed a more gradual, steady increase over the years, with Health showing a relatively consistent rise.Cerals and products and transportation have shown more fluctuations in prices.
- When COVID hits in starting few months the increase in prices was not much after that activities resumed with continous increase.
